# libsubs

A small library for fetching subtitles from the internet.
Currently only supports English subtitles from OpenSubtitles.org (almost).

Pull requests are welcome, as long as you write tests for your modifications :smile:

## TODO

- finish opensubtitles fetch function
- multi-threaded downloads
- support other languages
- support other websites
